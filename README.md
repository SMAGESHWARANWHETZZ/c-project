SMART ELECTRICITY BILL 
ABSTRACT:
                        My C â€“ Mini project involves the processing and display of our electricity bill through a smart way with some additional features .Basic details which are required for the electricity bill to confirm and differentiate distinct users such name details, address number, address, hometown and phone number are retrieved from the use. The Government from state also providing some subsidiaries for the people of their own states which differ from state to state .Considering similar thing in to account I have made a condition similar from my own thought of giving subsidiary for people those who are consuming power less than 100 units. People who consume as a total of only less than or equal to 100 units per month then each unit costs only rupees 6 for them and then the bill amount is printed in the bill. So that people those who consume power more than 100 units per month as a total then each units costs rupees 10 for them. Then comes my most important inclusion, when people pays bill which bars the stated date and time penalty rupees will be added as an extra charge. The outline of the bill is also programmed and the required details are also printed in a sequenced and ordered format such that it resembles the original bill.
